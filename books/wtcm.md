# Words That Change Minds

- Author: Shelle Rose Charvet
- You think words are just words, but if you want to get your message across and convince the other person to respond in the way you want them to, you have to be a little clever.
- The author gives you a precious insight into 14 different patterns you can use to influence those around you and get what you want.
- You will learn how to build trust, a sense of rapport, and most importantly, learn how to communicate intelligently, gently influencing the conversation towards your side of the line.
- **"Do you feel bad enough now to make some changes, or would you rather wait until you feel even worse?"**

## Chapter 1 - Not everyone thinks in the same way as you
- **Choosing the correct language is vital if you want a successful outcome to a conversation.**
- Once you understand someone's motivation, the way they handle stress, the language they respond to best, and how they make decisions, you can use the correct type of language to build up trust, create a rapport, and therefore communicate positively and effectively.

## Chapter 2 - Neuro Linguistic Programming is a major game changer in communication
- NLP is Neuro Linguistic Programming, LAB is Language And Behavior profile.
- NLP which was established in the mid 1970's is about understanding and reaching into an individual's mindset, figuring out what is unique about them, and then working out the best way to communicate with them to get the right outcome.
- LAB is a system based upon NLP and takes the idea a step further, working with different behavior patterns to understand what makes up a person's model of the world, therefore giving you the best communication options for that specific person.
- **NLP is a way of delving into someone's reality and communicating in a way that influences them best.**
- As you practice the different areas of NLP, you will find it easier to know what to say without really thinking about it.
- The whole idea behind NLP is that people respond far better when you speak their language and by assessing their personality and how they respond, you'll know the words to use.

## Chapter 3 - We view the world via filters before creating our independent opinion
- To communicate and perceive the world around us, we all use three specific filters: deletion, distortion, and generalization.
- **We do not see the world in black and white. We filter out what we want to see and decipher it in our own unique way.**
- **Deletion** is natural, we tend to delete much of the information around us and pick out the things we assume to be necessary.
- We **distort** things around us quite a lot too by allowing our imagination to think about how we want things to be or how we would imagine things to look, and we use that model as the basis of our thinking.
- We also **generalize**, and this is the key to how we learn. We take a few examples of a specific subject, and we build up a general idea from there.
- **People transform their experience, their opinions, and so on, in ways that correspond to their particular deletions, distortions, and generalizations.**

## Chapter 4 - Learn how to use influencing language to connect with those around us
- **Influencing language** is the best language to use when communicating with people and get what you want out of the conversation and steer it towards the destination you want to reach.
- **Every person has their own way of speaking, listening, and connecting with others. We have our own love language, and we have our own way of communicating, too. We're unique!**
- Every person reacts differently to different types of words, phrases, and body language.
- **Understanding a person's way of communicating helps to reduce misunderstandings and conflicts.**

## Chapter 5 - Everyone has a different motivation when communicating with others - what's yours?
- The first step is to work out what their motivation is and where it comes from.
