# Words That Change Minds

- Author: **Shelle Rose Charvet**
- You think words are just words, but if you want to get your message across and convince the other person to respond in the way you want them to, you have to be a little clever.
- The author gives you a precious insight into 14 different patterns you can use to influence those around you and get what you want.
- You will learn how to build trust, a sense of rapport, and most importantly, learn how to communicate intelligently, gently influencing the conversation towards your side of the line.
- **"Do you feel bad enough now to make some changes, or would you rather wait until you feel even worse?"**

## Chapter 1 - Not everyone thinks in the same way as you
- **Choosing the correct language is vital if you want a successful outcome to a conversation.**
- Once you understand someone's motivation, the way they handle stress, the language they respond to best, and how they make decisions, you can use the correct type of language to build up trust, create a rapport, and therefore communicate positively and effectively.

## Chapter 2 - Neuro Linguistic Programming is a major game changer in communication
- NLP is Neuro Linguistic Programming, LAB is Language And Behavior profile.
- NLP which was established in the mid 1970's is about understanding and reaching into an individual's mindset, figuring out what is unique about them, and then working out the best way to communicate with them to get the right outcome.
- LAB is a system based upon NLP and takes the idea a step further, working with different behavior patterns to understand what makes up a person's model of the world, therefore giving you the best communication options for that specific person.
- **NLP is a way of delving into someone's reality and communicating in a way that influences them best.**
- As you practice the different areas of NLP, you will find it easier to know what to say without really thinking about it.
- The whole idea behind NLP is that people respond far better when you speak their language and by assessing their personality and how they respond, you'll know the words to use.

## Chapter 3 - We view the world via filters before creating our independent opinion
- To communicate and perceive the world around us, we all use three specific filters: deletion, distortion, and generalization.
- **We do not see the world in black and white. We filter out what we want to see and decipher it in our own unique way.**
- **Deletion** is natural, we tend to delete much of the information around us and pick out the things we assume to be necessary.
- We **distort** things around us quite a lot too by allowing our imagination to think about how we want things to be or how we would imagine things to look, and we use that model as the basis of our thinking.
- We also **generalize**, and this is the key to how we learn. We take a few examples of a specific subject, and we build up a general idea from there.
- **People transform their experience, their opinions, and so on, in ways that correspond to their particular deletions, distortions, and generalizations.**

## Chapter 4 - Learn how to use influencing language to connect with those around us
- **Influencing language** is the best language to use when communicating with people and get what you want out of the conversation and steer it towards the destination you want to reach.
- **Every person has their own way of speaking, listening, and connecting with others. We have our own love language, and we have our own way of communicating, too. We're unique!**
- Every person reacts differently to different types of words, phrases, and body language.
- **Understanding a person's way of communicating helps to reduce misunderstandings and conflicts.**

## Chapter 5 - Everyone has a different motivation when communicating with others - what's yours?
- The first step is to work out what their motivation is and where it comes from.
- There are two patterns to look for when assessing someone's motivation origin - proactive and reactive.
- A proactive person is a go-better. They often act without really thinking things through; they're risk-takers and like to initiate action, rather than sitting around and waiting for something to happen.
- A recative person thinks before they act, often thinking for too long and then missing out on opportunities.
- An assertive/proactive person will be pretty direct and to the point. They will speak in short sentences and might come over as impatient, showing body language such as fidgeting or tapping their fingers on the desk.
- A reactive person will speak in a way that shows they need to understand what is going on around them, asking many questions and showing caution. They will also use sentences that aren't quite complete, and they're happy to sit down for long periods.
- **The population is split relatively evenly between proactive people and reactive people.**
- The best-influencing languages to use with a proactive person are phrases and words such as "why wait", "what are you waiting for", "let's hurry with this".
- The best language to use with a reactive person is "this will help you to understand", "let's think about this".

## Chapter 6 - Beware of pressing hot buttons when communicating with others
- Everyone has specific subject areas or types of language that cause their emotions to flare and their temper to rise.
- **Emotional triggers can make you happy, sad, angry, or downright furious. By understanding your own, you'll be more able to spot them in other people.**
- To find out, you need to pay attention to the way they speak, their body language, and the words they don't say, e.g., tone of voice, facial experssions.
- To identify and use them in the right way, you need to ask questions such as "What is important to you?", "What would there have to be to meet your needs?", "What counts to you?".
- **You pay attention to how people answer instead of what they say.**

## Chapter 7 - Identify a person's direction in life to communicate in a more effective way
- Identifying where a person is going in life can help you understand how to reach the goal you're aiming toward.
- There are two main behavior patterns: moving toward a goal or moving away from problems.
- **Look for verbal and non-verbal cues when assessing whether someone is trying to avoid a subject, or move directly toward it.**
- A person who moves towards a goal in a particular context is likely to be excitable when discussing that subject. You should use words such as "attain", "get", "achieve", or "have".
- A person moving away from a problem tends to become more animated when trying to address a threat. You should use words such as "eliminate", "solve", "prevent".

## Chapter 8 - You can steer conversations rightly when you learn how people respond to anger and difficult situations
- There are two main patterns to look for - self and others.
- Someone within the "self" section doesn't tend to show their emotions, and instead, they keep them locked away. Sometimes they respond to the situation immediately, and other times their reaction is delayed because they assess whether the problem is appropriate to react to act that moment or not.
- A person in the "self" section finds it challenging to build up a rapport with other people, and they often miss out on non-verbal cues, such as body language. They're not particularly great at taking hints either. It is thought that one in every 14 people has this pattern.
- **How do you communicate when you're under pressure? Do you stumble over your words or do you avoid the subject? Be mindful of your own approach to understand others better.**
- A person in the "others" section is often influenced very heavily by the emotions and behaviors of those around them, and is someone who can pick up on the slightest clue, such as a change in body language, facial experssions, and how someone's tone of voice changes when they speak. This one is very people-oriented, so they build up trust and rapport quite quickly.

## Chapter 9 - The way someone responds to stress speaks volumes about them
- There are three main patterns: Feeling, Choice and Thinking.
- Someone with a **feeling** pattern cannot handle a high-stress type of job, and they show emotional responses to an average level of workplace stress.
- A person in the **thinking** pattern has an initial emotional response, but they can overcome it pretty quickly, and they return
