# The 12 Week Year: Get More Done in 12 Weeks Than Others Do in 12 Months
- Author: **Brian P. Moran, Michael Lennington**
- If you could do things differently, would you be willing to achieve in 12 weeks, what you can achieve in 12 months? The answer is: commitment.
- Commitment is a way of life that affects every aspect of your existence. It determines everything about your life and how productive you can become now and in the future.
- **Let him who would enjoy a good future waste none of his present.** by Roger Ward Babson

## Chapter 1 - Your inability to commit to set goals is the major reason you are not productive
- **The decisions you make today determines the results you get tomorrow. If you want a great future, you need to make better decisions.**
- Making better decisions comes with having a commitment towards something. When you're committed, you're in charge and in control of the whole process. 
- Commitment to someone or something means you're making a conscious effort to be better every day.
- Each day of your life is essential, and that's why you must make conscious use of your time.
- The authors have developed a 12 Week Year plan that allows you to bring forth your most important interests for the year and act on them within three months.
- There's no limit to what you can achieve as long as you are committed to it.
- Commitment is not an easy task, and it's meant for people who are absolutely willing to brave the storm to reach the golden sky.
- **The number-one thing that you will have to sacrifice to be great, to achieve what you are capable of, and to execute your plans, is your comfort.**

## Chapter 2 - The most difficult challenge people face is not the lack of knowledge, but the lack of execution
- **We all have two lives; the one we live and the one we're capable of living."** by Steven Pressfield, the author of "The War of Art".
