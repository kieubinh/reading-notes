# The 12 Week Year: Get More Done in 12 Weeks Than Others Do in 12 Months
- Author: **Brian P. Moran, Michael Lennington**
- If you could do things differently, would you be willing to achieve in 12 weeks, what you can achieve in 12 months? The answer is: commitment.
- Commitment is a way of life that affects every aspect of your existence. It determines everything about your life and how productive you can become now and in the future.
- **Let him who would enjoy a good future waste none of his present.** by Roger Ward Babson

## Chapter 1 - Your inability to commit to set goals is the major reason you are not productive
- **The decisions you make today determines the results you get tomorrow. If you want a great future, you need to make better decisions.**
- Making better decisions comes with having a commitment towards something. When you're committed, you're in charge and in control of the whole process. 
- Commitment to someone or something means you're making a conscious effort to be better every day.
- Each day of your life is essential, and that's why you must make conscious use of your time.
- The authors have developed a 12 Week Year plan that allows you to bring forth your most important interests for the year and act on them within three months.
- There's no limit to what you can achieve as long as you are committed to it.
- Commitment is not an easy task, and it's meant for people who are absolutely willing to brave the storm to reach the golden sky.
- **The number-one thing that you will have to sacrifice to be great, to achieve what you are capable of, and to execute your plans, is your comfort.**

## Chapter 2 - The most difficult challenge people face is not the lack of knowledge, but the lack of execution
- **We all have two lives; the one we live and the one we're capable of living."** by Steven Pressfield, the author of "The War of Art".
- Knowledge without execution is futile and useless.
- The key to experencing growth is understanding the power of execution.
- When you always do what's expected of you, you'll have no problem increasing your productivity.
- Once we can consistently focus on what works, we'll be able to do things quite easily.
- **"If we did the things we are capable of doing, we would literally astound ourselves."** by Thomas Edison.
- Each day is important to our lives, and that's why we must be careful of annualized thinking.
- Deadlines motivate us to do many things because of the thrills associated with it.
- Creat a feasible deadline for yourself today and work assiduously towards achieving it.
- Achieving effective execution isn't as complicated as we think, but it's not as easy as we believe it is either.
- The problem most individuals or companies have with effective execution is that it requires taking new actions.
- In a lot of cases, new actions are uncomfortable and very difficult.
- The difficulty in achieving the set goals in new actions can be very overwhelming to extent where it seems like a good idea to abandon it.
- We need to attach a strong emotional stake to the long-term outcome of a plan by making sure that our life visions and business visions are aligned.
- **Having a plan without executing it is a futile attempt at being productive - the most productive people are those who have plans and work towards achieving them.**

## Chapter 3 - Consitent action is the key to getting what you desire most in life
- If we want to know what the future holds for us, all we need to do is to look at our actions because they best predict the future.
- **Unless commitment is made, there are only promises and hopes; but no plans.**
- If you want to predict your health, take a look at what you eat and how well you exercise. Same applies to your marriage, career, business, etc.
- A weekly plan helps you focus on the elements contained in your plan. If you can complete the weekly plans for 12 weeks, you will find out that it's easier to achieve your goals if you're committed.
- Your goals are there to keep you on track with your vision. Without a goal, you'll end up achieving nothing. When your goals are aligned with your vision, it becomes easier for you to increase your productivity without any negative effect.
- Too often, we end up losing track of where we stand, so we barely know when to improve and when to relax.
- The major reason why sports is exciting to people is scorekeeping. In sports, scores are kept as data, giving the individual, team, spectators, etc., and idea of where they stand and what they need to do.
- **People lose or win by scores and statistics. Having a way to measure your ability is very important to know where you stand.**
- You should create a weekly scorecard that helps you to understand how well you're developing.
- **If we take care of the minutes, the years will take care of themselves."** by Benjamin Franklin.
- You must value your time by understanding the importance of saying yes or no.
- Valuing your time helps you to understand the true meaning of accountability.
- Accountability is not holding someone responsible for an action, but owning to the results of the choices you make.
- The only accountability that should exist in your life is self-accountability - hold yourself responsible for your actions because every decision you take is as a result of the choice you made.

## Chapter 4 - We often mistake interest for commitment when it comes to developing ideas and formulating them
- Developing an interest in something doesn't automatically translate into committing to that thing.
- If you're really interseted in something, you must take actionable steps to show your commitment to it.
- The four keys to a successful commitment are strong desire, keystone actions, cost counting, and the desire to act on commitments rather than feelings.
  + Strong desire arises from having a clear and personally compelling reason to do something. Without a strong desire, you will falter when things get very tough.
  + Keystone actions involve knowing the core actions that will produce the results you are after. Find the essential activities in your plans and work on them.
  + **Count the costs** by considering the costs of a commitment. It helps you to prepare mentally and physically for the task ahead.
  + **Act on your commitments and not your feelings.** It might seem very difficult and daunting to do some things, but what makes it a commitment is knowing how to override your feelings to keep yourself motivated.
- Another mistake we often make is that we concentrate on too many things, thereby losing focus on the most important things in the process. There's a huge chance that you are always multitasking, trying to do eveything at once. This is not an ideal way to live - it's not suited for your body in any way. Don't rush trying to make up for a lost time.
- **Take each day as it comes and make full use of it. If you're hell-bent on making up for a lost time, you'll end up losing the present and the future in return.**
- To effectively maximize your interests and time, it's important to find a balance between your work and your life.
- Work-life balance is only achievable by the choices you make in life.
- If your work negates your life or vice-versa, the decision to quit or stay rests in your hands.
- Work-life balance can never be equal, and we should accept that. There's no way you can equally balance the time you spend at work with the time you spend for yourself - one has to be higher than the other.
- The only way you can achieve a balance is by setting up a plan for yourself on how you can maximize the time you spend on each aspect of your life.

## Chapter 5 - The execution system helps you to make conscious decisions about your life
- This system is based on **8 elements**: **vision, planning, process control, measurement, time use, accountability, commitment, and greatness in the moment**, which divided into two groups: **the five disciplines** (the 5 first ones) and **the three principles** (the 3 last ones).
  + **Accountability** is owning up to your successes and failures. It's accepting ownership of the situations in your life because most of the things that happen to you are as a result of the decisions you've made.
  + **Commitment** is putting in a lot of effort into keeping to the promises you made to yourself.
  + **Greatness in the moment** is in realizing that committing to a particular thing is an act of greatness itself. Achieving a result is not the greatness; it's only a confirmation of your commitment. True greatness is attached to your commitment to a plan.
  + **Vision** You need to create a sustainable vision for yourself that means you're establishing a reason why you should stay committed to achieving a set goal.
  + **Planning** A working plan helps you focus on the most important things in your life.
  + **Process control** These are the plans you have put in place to facilitate successful processes to an event.
  + 
- **Create an effective plan that makes long-term goals your priority.**
