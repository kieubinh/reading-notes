- Author: Scott Galloway
- In The Four, Galloway analyzes Facebook, Apple, Amazon and Google to reveal secrets that make them successful.
- He also extracts lessons from these companies to give a head start to anyone desiring to build companies of such magnitude.
- **"If there is a blunter, more opinionated, faster-talking expert on the Internet than Scott Galloway, I haven't come across him. Or her"** by Philip Elmer - Dewitt, Fortune.

## Chapter 1 - The rise of the four horsemen
- Apple displaced IBM; Facebook took people from MySpace; Amazon overrode Walmart and other retail stores; and for Goole, it was Yahoo.
- **Non-visionary companies always lose out to their visionary counterparts.**

## Chapter 2 - Earth's most customer-centric company (AMAZON)
- Earth's most customer-centric company, where customers can find and discover anything they might want to buy online and to offer customers the lowest possible prices.
- **If you run an organization, be loyal to your founding vision.**
- With every innovation, Amazon seeks to better customer experience and reduce costs - two factors that keep it head and shoulders above its competition.
- **Given a 10 percent chance of a hundred times payout, you should take that bet every time.** by Jeff Bezors.
- Most entrepreneurs and CEOs are risk-takers, but there's a level of risk many won't take. How many people are comfortable taking risks with a 10% chance?
- We're accustomed to taking risks with only 50% or more chances of success. That has to change. Become more risk-loving - just don't be unreal with your expectations.

## Chapter 3 - Luxury always wins (APPLE)
- How can you control just 14.5% of your market and still get 79% of global profits from the same market? By creating irreplaceable luxury products like Apple.
- **Scarcity and luxury, if used well, will make any company filthy rich.**
- Apple users tend to be rational by highlighting the higher features and performance of Apple products compared to other brands, which may be true, but that's all that's going on.
- Luxury appeals to our most innate and primitive need: the desire to appeal to the other sex.
- According to Darwinian history, the hunter-gatherers who gave out stronger mating signals were perceived as having higher survival abilities, and factors like wealth, luxury, and comfort are strong signals.
- **Some people think luxury is the opposite of poverty. It is not. It is the opposite of vulgarity.**

## Chapter 4 - Facebook and Google are taking over the advertising world
- Traditional advertising was a good option until algorithms became smarter.
- The main problems with the traditional way are congregation and targeting.
- Essentially, more people consume digital than analog information - especially the younger generation.
- Digital media is cheaper, more comfortable, and easily accessible.
- The second advantage digital media has is targeting. FB & GG can accurately predict what ads will appeal most to you based on your search query and online behavior.
- **Facebook's ability to help us connect with others is the reason the company is so successful.**
- If numbers mean anything (and they do), Facebook is the most successful company in business history, as it has at least 2.7 billion users.
- Statistics reveal that one in every six questions people ask Google are things they haven't asked anyone before.

## Chapter 5 - Lie your way to building a multibillion-dollar conglomerate
- There's hardly anything successful that didn't get there by copying others.
- All of the most advanced countries in our world today copied something about politics and industrialization from others. One of the reasons they do so is to keep tabs on the latest information so they can use it for their own growth.
- **Copy from those who have gone ahead of you. But do it creatively so that your uniqueness will find experssion.**
- The big tech companies all climbed to the top by copying from competitors and in a way that keeps them from facing legal consequences. One tactic is buying up smaller companies with smart ideas or giving the companies incentives to let them see their unique way of doing things.
- **Be like the horsemen. Copy smartly.**

## Chapter 6 - A trillion dollars and market dominance are what you need to take on the four
- No company can dream of replacing the four or joining their ranks without having at least $1 trillion in market valuation and a sufficient amount of world dominance.
- There are at least eight factors at play.
- **Product differentiation.** If you can come up with outstanding products the world has never seen before, great. On the other hand, what you can do is outline your current value chain from start to finish and determine what areas tech can help add value or reduce pain. For example, Amazon, is doing this by using tech to aid customer fulfillment.
- **Visionary capital.** Can you come up with a bold vision that would attract capital easily?
- **Global reach.**. This should go as a no-brainer.
- **Likeability.** If you're perceived as a good company that exists to serve people, not exploit them.
- **Companies that are highly likable are more likely to attract better talent.**
- **Vertical Integration.** Own your brand. Ensure you're in control of as much of the customer experience as possible.
- **AI.** Every company that will be successful in the digital age must mater how to use AI to gather data about its users.
- **Accelerant.** This is a feature that presents you as a career accelerator.
- **Geography.** They need to quickly develop and employ the best talents coming from outstanding engineering universities.
- So who will be the fifth horseman? Alibaba, Tesla, Uber, Airbnb, Microsoft, and IBM.
