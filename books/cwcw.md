- "Shooting will come soon enough. But first, you must chop wood and carry water." by _Joshua Medcalf_

## Chapter 1 - You must be ready to do what it takes to be successful
- In essence, we must chop wood and carry water to get anywhere in life. This entails learning new things, submitting to people, and learning from others, ourselves, and life.
- "Success is no accident. It is hard work, perseverance, learning, studying, sacrifice, and most of all, love of what you are doing or learning to do." - by _Pele_.
- We all love the awe and aura of greatness so much that we look forward to being great one day.
- **The process of greatness begins with the dream to be great.**
- Dreaming about greatness is the easiest part. We must awake from dreaming and take the most important step toward greatness - **action**.
- You can never be great without chopping wood and carrying water, and you cannot build a house without laying the foundation.
- Wood and water mean different things to different people. It may be writing more for some, taking a course, reading a book, or going on a trip.
- In this book, you will discover general principles that explain how to fall in love with the process of becoming great and how to take action toward greatness in life.

## Chapter 2 - Learn from doing monotonous activities to become great
- Imagine the process of carrying water and chopping wood as an opportunity to grow, a period where you get to be the judge of how well you do and how much you learn.
- Do not see the period as a test or competition because doing that hampers your potential.
- **To maximize your time doing the ordinary, you need to identify what wood or water you need to carry.**
- **The only thing that is truly significant about today, or any other day, is who you become in the process.** 
- The process may not be smooth or the best pathway you will come across, but all that will not matter. What will matter in the long haul is what you use the process for, how the process influenced you, and what became about you after the process.
