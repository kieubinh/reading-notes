# The Psychology of Money
- Author: Morgan Housel
- The author argues that doing well with money doesn't have as much to do with knowledge as it has to do with behavior. And behavior is one of the hardest things to teach, but Housel goes deep into it in this book, showing readers little behavioral changes that will greatly impact their net worth.

## Chapter 1 - No one is crazy
- People make terrible money decisions all the time, but it's not because they don't think properly. It's just that when it comes to money, we are all different.
- Housel estimates that your experience with money makes up 0.000000001% of what the reset of the world experiences.
- **Doing well with money has a little to do with how smart you are and a lot to do with how you behave. And behavior is hard to teach, even to really smart people.**
- We have been programmed to believe the results we get are 100% the consequences of our actions. When you fail, it's because you did something wrong. And when you succeed with an investment, you're a good investor. But reality isn't always so.
- Success is usually not untraceable to favorable events like meeting mentors or being in the right place at the right time - that's the uncontrollable factor.
- **It's pride to assume all your successes are direct results of your hard work alone.**
- Don't be quick to judge people's finances when you don't know the whole story.
- We can do almost nothing about luck and risk and how they affect our finances, but there are other things in our control and it's wisdom to focus on maximizing the things you can control.

## Chapter 2 - Stop chasing money
- Many people don't realize they're already putting money above happiness.
- You may think you're working for yourself and the future of your family, but the real reason could be that you're just working hard to earn more than a neighbor.
- **Your happiness can never be compared with money; don't chase money at its expense.**
- **Controlling your time is the highest dividend money pays.**

## Chapter 3 - Be keen about playing a long-term game
- Treat personal and corporate finance as a long-term game and you're more likely to last longer playing it.
- Investors who are only interested in short-term gains hardly play long. And it has nothing to do with their skills.
- **Your investing skill will bring you money, but you need more than skill to sustain wealth.**
- When you have a long-term goal and keep compounding on a good annual rate, you stand a better chance of building sustainable wealth than another person who is just in for the quick gains.

## Chapter 4 - The happiness code
- According to the Americans interviewed, what made them happy was having meaningful relationships, spending quality time with family, and being part of something bigger than themselves.
- **Nothing matters more than your happiness!**

## Chapter 5 - Don't aim to be rich, aim to be wealthy
- Riches are what you see as an external observer, but wealth is usually hidden.
- Wealth is the money you save and invest. It's the assets you own.
- **When it comes to building wealth, you have no one to impress.**
- Don't buy stuff you don't need to show off to people who don't even care about you.
- The reason people buy fancy stuff they don't need is because they feel it will attract respect and admiration.

## Chapter 6 - Conclusion
- Uncertainty is the nature of life. We do our best to predict outcomes and outline actions in lieu of them, but it doesn't mean things will always go our way.
- Life happens and we must learn to adjust accordingly. If you made certain projections for your investments and they go as you imagined, great. But when that doesn't happen, it's important to rise quickly and change plans.
- Be flexible enough to make changes when it's not working.
- People sometimes make crazy financial decisions, but no one is crazy.
- We're all limited by our knowledge, experience, and the state of the market we're trading.
- Protect your happiness at all costs: stay out of shady deals, don't chase money, and always create time for the important thing in your life because in the end, what's the use of the money if you can't enjoy it?
