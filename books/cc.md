# Crucial Conversations - Tools for Talking When Stakes are High
- Author: _Kerry Patterson, Joseph Grenny, Ron McMillan, AI Switzer_
- Where the "problems" arise is when the conversations turn crucial - there are high stakes involved, opinions vary, or emotions run high.
- We generally fail to handle these other types of conversations well for several reasons. For one, we don't even recognize the moment the conversation transitioned from plain vanilla into the crucial territory.
- Also, when we do realize we are in "crucial zone", we have no modus operandi for dealing with it.

## Chapter 1 - The crucial conversations you get into during the course of your day have an effect on the quality of your personal and professional life
- Crucial conversations are the day-to-day conversations that affect your life, as opposed to plain vanilla conversations.
- For example, when you and a boss differ on whether or not you are ready for a promotion; when the stakes are high, in a strategy meeting when the company is not meeting its annual growth rate; and when emotions run strong, when you are in the midst of an emotional standoff with your spouse.
- Crucial conversations are what they are because the results have a huge impact on the quality of your life.
- We often back away from having them because we fear that we will make matters worse. Instead, we adopt all kinds of tactics to dodge touchy issues. We send an email to a colleague instead of walking down the hall to talk cold-turkey. Bosses leave voicemails in lieu of meeting with their direct reports.
- Strong relationships, careers, organizations, and communities all draw from the same source of power - the ability to talk openly about high-stakes, emotional, controversial topics.

## Chapter 2 - The bigger The Pool of Shared Meaning is in a crucial conversation, the better the outcomes that result from it
- Most of us think we are limited to either/or choices, also known sa The Fool's Choice - a choice between telling the truth and losing a friend - in a crucial conversation.
- Dialogue is the free flow of meaning between two or more people.
- The free flow of information means every party involved is able to openly and honestly express their opinions, share their feelings, and articulate their theories.
- They willingly and capably share their views, even when their ideas are controversial or unpopular.
- Those skilled know how to get all relevant information from others and out into the open.
- We all enter into conversations with our opinions, feelings, theories, and expectations about the topic at hand. Their unique combination makes up our personal pool of meaning; which informs us and direct our actions.
- When two or more people enter into a crucial conversation, they **don't share the same pool of meaning**. Together, they create a **shared pool of meaning**.
- People who are skilled at dialogue make it safe for everyone to add their meaning to the shared pool.
- They don't need to agree to every idea. They just want all ideas out in the open.
- The Pool of Shared Meaning is the group's IQ, and the larger it is, the better the quality of decisions taken from it.

## Chapter 3 - Getting your heart right, first, is the key to getting your crucial conversations right
- No crucial conversation of yours will succeed without the right "heartitude".
- When you are in a crucial conversation and your heart is not right, your behavior degenerates. Then your motives degenerate and you reach a point where you believe that the other party is the source of everything that is wrong with you. That belief keeps you from taking action that could lead to dialogue and progress.
- People who dialogue purposefully turn the belief's logic on its head by believeing that the best way to make a dialogue work is by starting first with their attitudes. They affirm the "Work on me first, us second" principle and understand that they are more likely to benefit if they improve their own approach.
- They realize the only person whose attitude they can work on influencing is themselves anyway.
- As much as you may need or want others to change, the only person you can continually inspire, prod, and shape - with any possibility of success - is you.
- Because you are continually trying to improve your dialogue skills, you become the most talented in the room.
- To get your heart right, clarify what you really want. For example, "I want my husband to be more reliable. I'm tired of being let down by him when he makes and fails on commitments that I depend on."
- Next, clarify what you really don't want. For example, "I don't want to have a useless and heated conversation that creates bad feelings and doesn't lead to change."
- Lastly, combine what you want and what you don't want into an "and" question. It will force you to search for more creative and productive options. For example, "How can I have a candid conversation with my husband about being more dependable and avoid creating bad feelings and wasting our time?"

## Chapter 4 - Learning to recognize the moment a conversation starts turning unhealthy will enable you to respond quickly and get it back on track
- A crucial conversation is made up of content, which is the topic under discussion and the conditions, what participants to the conversation are doing in response to the flow of information.
- When the crucial conversation begins to turn unhealthy, we should take steps to remedy the conversation. There are three indicators you should watch out for.
