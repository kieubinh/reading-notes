# Crucial Conversations - Tools for Talking When Stakes are High
- Author: _Kerry Patterson, Joseph Grenny, Ron McMillan, AI Switzer_
- Where the "problems" arise is when the conversations turn crucial - there are high stakes involved, opinions vary, or emotions run high.
- We generally fail to handle these other types of conversations well for several reasons. For one, we don't even recognize the moment the conversation transitioned from plain vanilla into the crucial territory.
- Also, when we do realize we are in "crucial zone", we have no modus operandi for dealing with it.

## Chapter 1 - The crucial conversations you get into during the course of your day have an effect on the quality of your personal and professional life
- Crucial conversations are the day-to-day conversations that affect your life, as opposed to plain vanilla conversations.
- For example, when you and a boss differ on whether or not you are ready for a promotion; when the stakes are high, in a strategy meeting when the company is not meeting its annual growth rate; and when emotions run strong, when you are in the midst of an emotional standoff with your spouse.
- Crucial conversations are what they are because the results have a huge impact on the quality of your life.
- We often back away from having them because we fear that we will make matters worse. Instead, we adopt all kinds of tactics to dodge touchy issues. We send an email to a colleague instead of walking down the hall to talk cold-turkey. Bosses leave voicemails in lieu of meeting with their direct reports.
- Strong relationships, careers, organizations, and communities all draw from the same source of power - the ability to talk openly about high-stakes, emotional, controversial topics.
