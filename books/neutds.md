# Naked Economics: Undressing The Dismal Science
- Author: **Charles Wheelan**
- Why is there a difference between the economics of the two countries? Why are some countries developed, and some are underdeveloped? Why is Bill Gates richer than you?
- Wheelan is the author of "Naked Statistics", "Naked Economics" and "Naked Money".

## Chapter 1 - Understanding the concepts of economics is key to knowing how and why a country can develop
- Humans are naturally selfish, but our selfishness doesn't come out of a dark place - it's an inherent natural that we have no choice but to exhibit.
- Our selfishness has led to many bad events, but on the bright side, it has led us to civilization.'
- **The need to be better off is what triggers our creativity and productivity.**
- Economics teaches us how selfishness, greed, and trade are essential to the growth of an economy.
- The most important part of any economy is trade.
- Trade is what gives us the chance to exchange what we have for what we want.
- Countries that are not developed are those that do not know how to trade.

## Chapter 2 - Greed and selfishness are inherent part of us that can be used for good
- Stores sell the products that people want to buy, and, in turn, companies produce items that stores want to stock.
- There is a finite supply of everything worth having: oil, coconut milk, perfect bodies, clean water, food, drinks, etc.
- The process of producing goods and services and trading them is what differentiates the gap between the rich and the poor individuals, organizations, or countries.
- Economics begins with one vey important assumption: people act to make themselves as rich as possible.
- Econimics don't particularly care what gives us utility; they simply accept that each of us has his or her own preferences and choices that determine how we live.
- Bill Gates is richer because people are more interested in his utility than they do in yours.
- **Our preferences majorly determine what we get utility and happiness from. Once we're happy doing something, we'll get more productive with it.**
- Economists believe that working to better our lives is suitable for any economy because it leads to creativity.
- **Economics is like gravity: Ignore it and you will be in for some rude surprises.**

## Chapter 3 - Good policies requrire creating incentives for the people in order to grow an economy
- **Good polices involve using incentives to channel people's behavior toward the desired outcome.**
- **"Greed is good, so make sure that you have it working on your side."** by Gordon Gekko in the movie "Wall Street".
- Some of the most interesting problems in economics involve situations in which individuals acting in their own best interest do things that make themselves worse.
- We must realize that greed and selfishness are an inherent nature of humans that cannot be overlooked.
- People will definitely act in their selfish interests, even if it would affect them in the long run.
- Economics teaches us how to use good incentives and why we must understand that people will always act selfishly, but it is left to us to channel that selfishness for a greater good.

## Chapter 4 - For an economy to improve, power must be shared between the government and the private sector
- **Sole reliance on the government to boost the economy has the tendency of leading to disaster.**
- Governments need to encourage prive organizations, but they must pay close attention to the dangers of monopoly.
- Monopoly stifles any need to be innovative or responsive to customers.
- The risks of monopoly are the major reasons why both the government and private organizations should not be allowed to be in charge totally.
- The government should not be the sole provider of a good or service unless there is a compelling reason to believe that the private sectior will fail in that role.
- For example, driver licensing belong to the government in most countries. Since people have no choice than to get a license from the licensing organization, the workers at there can become rude or condescending to the people without fear. It doesn't matter how rude or mean a worker is to you; you will still have to go back if you need a license.
- In short, the government is like a physician's tool: it is an intrusive method that can be used for good or ill. When used carefully and judiciously, it will facilitate the body's remarkable ability to heal itself quickly. When misused or placed in the wrong hands, it can cause great harm.
- **The government's view of the economy could be summed up in a few short phrases: If it moves, tax it. If it keeps moving, regulate it. And if it stops moving, subsidize it.**

## Chapter 5 - Information matters, particularly when we don't have all that we need
- The truth is that what we don't know can hurt us.
- Economics teaches us how we acquire information, what we do with it, and how we make decisions with the information we get.
- The need for information is why we have branding and why branding is an essential aspect of the trade.
- **Branding is what makes us shop for products and services whose quality we cannot quickly determine.**
- Branding is what makes us buy a book without knowing its content.
- It solves a problem for consumers - how do you select products whose quality or safety you can determine only after using them?
- Consumers will trust your products based on the information available to them through your branding.

## Chapter 6 - Human capital is what distinguishes a novice from a professional
- Human capital is the total number of skills embodied within an individual. It ranges from education, intelligence, charisma, creativity, work experience, entrepreneurial vigor, to our ability to do what might look basic to others.
