## Chapter 1 - Connecting with other people is essential for our survival as humans
- We need other people to survive; none of us can live a happy and healthy life in isolation.
- Other people are our greatest resource in life; without them, we simply cannot exist.
- Connecting with other people brings infinite rewards.
- One of the benefits of creating meaningful connections with others is longevity. When you make connections, your entire being, especially your brain, grows and flourishes.
- Being socially active doesn't mean hanging out with the same old crowd and pedaling around on an exercise bike. It means getting out and making new friends, you also make new connections in the inside world, your brain.

## Chapter 2 - Building relationships with others makes us feel safe and does our community a lot of good
- **Creating meaningful bonds with others makes us feel loved.**
- Humans benefit from each other emotionally. None of us is a closed self-regulating system. Instead, we are open loops regulated, disciplined, encouraged, criticized, supported and validated by the emotional feedback we get from others.
- If you know how to make fast, meaningful connections with people, you will also discover the enjoyment of being able to approach anyone with confidence and sincerity.
- **Your likability has very little to do with how good looking you are.**
- Whether or not people will find you likable is highly dependent on how well you are able to connect with others.
- Likeable people generally give loud and clear signals of their willingness to be socialbe; they reveal that their public communication channels are open.
- **If people like you, they feel natural and comfortable around you.**

## Chapter 3 - It is essential to make the right impression during the first few seconds of a meeting
- **No matter the form the meeting takes, the first impression matters a lot.**
- If you make the right impression during the first few seconds of a new meeting, you create an awareness that you are sincere, safe, and trustworthy.
- The process of greeting consists of 5 parts: **Open, Eye, Beam, Hi!, Lean**.
- The first element is to open your body language and attitude. Try as much as possible to make sure your attitude is positive, and keep your heart aimed directly at the person you're meeting. Make sure your arms or hands aren't covering your heart. When possible, unbutton your jacket or coat.
- The second part is making eye contact. Let your eyes reflect your positive attitude.
- The third step is to beam. Be the first to smile, and make sure your smile reflects your attitude.
- The forth step is to say "Hi!" or "Hello!", saying it with pleasing tonality and attach your own name to it. For instance, "Hi! I'm Anthony." This is the point where you are in a position to gather lots of free information about the person you're meeting.
- The fifth step is to extend your hand to the other person and find a way to say the person's name two or three times to help fix it in memory. For instance, "Great to meet you, Suzanne".
- The final part is the "lean". This action can be an almost unnoticieable forward tilt to very subtly indicate your interest and openness as you start to "synchronize" the person you've just met.
- **Point your heart at the other person and say hello. Light up your eyes and smile.**

## Chapter 4 - To establish rapport with others, you must synchronize your interests with theirs
- Rapport is the creation of common ground - a comfort zone where two or more people can mentally join together.
- The prize you get for establishing rapport with someone is that person's positive acceptance. It will imply something like this: "I know I just met you, but I like you so I will trust you with my attention."
- **Whether you are trying to make a sale, get a date, or wangle out of a traffic ticket, eastablishing a rapport is very important.**
- Sometimes a rapport just happens naturally and you have no clue why. However, there are other times when you just find it very hard to connect with another person no matter how hard you try.
- Rapport comes in two forms: Rapport by chance and rapport by design.
- **Rapport by chance**. For example, when you go to a country where people do not speak your language, you feel uncomfortable but you suddenly meet someone from your own country. You have a new best friend for your vacation at least.
- **Rapport is established when the interests or the behavior of two or more people are synchronized.**
- **Rapport by design**. When you have nothing in common with the person you are trying to connect with, rapport by design is established by deliberately altering your behavior, just for a short time, in order to become like the other person. A technique called "synchronizing" is to purposely reduce the distance and differences between another person and yourself by finding common ground.

## Chapter 5 - Synchronizing is an adapting device that allows you to make smooth connections at will and quickly
- When trying to be in sync with someone else, your main task is to do exactly what the other person does; you can either synchronize the other person's attitude or body language.
- **Synchronizing the other person's attitude involves picking up on their feelings and mirroring it back to them.**
- To achieve this, mirror the person's movements, breathing pattern and expression as you "deeply identify" with them. Tune in to the overall mood signaled by their voice and reflect it back. -> "I don't know what it is about this person, but there's something I really like!"
- **Anything that enhances the common ground and decreases the distance between you and the other person is a good thing."
- **Synchronizing body language is of two kinds: mirroring and matching.**
- **Matching**. Doing the same thing as the other person. For example, she moves her left hand, you move your left hand.
- **Mirroring**. Moving as if you were looking at the other person in a mirror. For example, he moves his left hand, you move your right hand.
- The key is to make your movements subtle and respectful.
- Get it right, and the communication can start. Get it wrong, and you'll have to **bargain for attention**.

## Chapter 6 - Having a good conversation is not all talk - it's listening, too
- Conversation comes in two equally important parts: **asking questions** and **actively listening**.
- **Your main aim during the earlier stages of your conversation is to search for common interests using small talks.**
- **Open questions** request an explannation, starting with one of 6 conversation-generating words: Who? When? What? Why? Where? How? For example, "How do you know that?", "Who told you?", "Where do you think this information comes from?"
- **To make your open question more effective, you can add sensory-specific verbs like "see", "tell", and "feel".**
- For instance, "Where do you see yourself by this time next year?", "Tell me why you decided on Bali for your vacation.", "How do you feel about calamari?"
- **Closed questions will close off your chances of rapport-inducing conversation."
- Try to avoid closed questions such as: Are you...? Do you...? Have you...?
- **The very fact that your question is open will guarantee that you quickly receive free information.**

## Chapter 7 - Active listening is the other side of the conversation coin
- The key to being an active listener lies in making a sincere effort to absorb what that person is saying and feeling.
- **You have to make an active attempt to grasp and understand the facts and the underlying feelings of what is being said.**
- The goal here is to make the person talking feel that you're listening and feel that you care.
- Encourage the other person verbally by giving spoken feedback such as "Wow", "Aha", "Oh", and "Hm". To make things more interesting,"Oh, really", "And then what?", and "You're not serious. So, what did he do?"
- **Give physical feedback by using an open and encouraging body language. For example, nod in agreement and make plenty of eye contact, but don't stare.**
- **Look away in thought intermittently throughout the conversation. For instance, looking at your hands from time to time gives the impression of participation."
- Listen and give spoken feedback based on your feelings and showing concern and interest in the other person. For instance, "wow, I can't believe that you've been coming here for three years and we've never met. You seem so interesting and I really wish I would have made your acquaintance sooner."

## Chapter 8 - Know what you want and adopt the best attitude to help you get it
- Your mind and body are part of the same system - they influence each other. When you are happy, you look happy, you sound happy, and you use happy words.
- **Attitudes are like trays on which you serve yourself up to other people.**
- There are two different types of attitudes: "Really Useful Attitude" or "Really Useless Attitude". Whichever type of attitude you choose to exhibit will determine whether the outcome of your meeting will be a positive or a negative one.
- **As far as communication is concerned, a useless attitude will get you nowhere.**
- No matter where you live or what you do, the quality of your attitude determines the quality of your relationships, and just about everything else in your life.

## Chapter 9 - Your posture, movements, and experssion will speak volumes about you before you even open your mouth
- **Ask yourself, 'What do I want, right now, at this moment? And which attitude will serve me best?**
- You should always know what you want from your communication and decide on the best attitude you need to get it.
- Once you know what you want and which is the most useful attitude to help you get it, our body language, voice, and words will automatically change to help you achieve your goal.
- **No matter how good you are at sweet-talking, people still won't find you likable if you have a bad attitude.**
- To always appear likable and to be able to create meaningful connections, always exhibit a **Really Useful Attitude**.
