## Chapter 1 - Connecting with other people is essential for our survival as humans
- We need other people to survive; none of us can live a happy and healthy life in isolation.
- Other people are our greatest resource in life; without them, we simply cannot exist.
- Connecting with other people brings infinite rewards.
- One of the benefits of creating meaningful connections with others is longevity. When you make connections, your entire being, especially your brain, grows and flourishes.
- Being socially active doesn't mean hanging out with the same old crowd and pedaling around on an exercise bike. It means getting out and making new friends, you also make new connections in the inside world, your brain.

## Chapter 2 - Building relationships with others makes us feel safe and does our community a lot of good
- **Creating meaningful bonds with others makes us feel loved.**
- Humans benefit from each other emotionally. None of us is a closed self-regulating system. Instead, we are open loops regulated, disciplined, encouraged, criticized, supported and validated by the emotional feedback we get from others.
- If you know how to make fast, meaningful connections with people, you will also discover the enjoyment of being able to approach anyone with confidence and sincerity.
- **Your likability has very little to do with how good looking you are.**
- Whether or not people will find you likable is highly dependent on how well you are able to connect with others.
- Likeable people generally give loud and clear signals of their willingness to be socialbe; they reveal that their public communication channels are open.
- **If people like you, they feel natural and comfortable around you.**

## Chapter 3 - It is essential to make the right impression during the first few seconds of a meeting
- **No matter the form the meeting takes, the first impression matters a lot.**
- If you make the right impression during the first few seconds of a new meeting, you create an awareness that you are sincere, safe, and trustworthy.
- The process of greeting consists of 5 parts: **Open, Eye, Beam, Hi!, Lean**.
- The first element is to open your body language and attitude. Try as much as possible to make sure your attitude is positive, and keep your heart aimed directly at the person you're meeting. Make sure your arms or hands aren't covering your heart. When possible, unbutton your jacket or coat.
- The second part is making eye contact. Let your eyes reflect your positive attitude.
- The third step is to beam. Be the first to smile, and make sure your smile reflects your attitude.
- The forth step is to say "Hi!" or "Hello!", saying it with pleasing tonality and attach your own name to it. For instance, "Hi! I'm Anthony." This is the point where you are in a position to gather lots of free information about the person you're meeting.
- The fifth step is to extend your hand to the other person and find a way to say the person's name two or three times to help fix it in memory. For instance, "Great to meet you, Suzanne".
- The final part is the "lean". This action can be an almost unnoticieable forward tilt to very subtly indicate your interest and openness as you start to "synchronize" the person you've just met.
- **Point your heart at the other person and say hello. Light up your eyes and smile.**

## Chapter 4 - To establish rapport with others, you must synchronize your interests with theirs.
- Rapport is the creation of common ground - a comfort zone where two or more people can mentally join together.
- The prize you get for establishing rapport with someone is that person's positive acceptance. It will imply something like this: "I know I just met you, but I like you so I will trust you with my attention."
- **Whether you are trying to make a sale, get a date, or wangle out of a traffic ticket, eastablishing a rapport is very important.**
- Sometimes a rapport just happens naturally and you have no clue why. However, there are other times when you just find it very hard to connect with another person no matter how hard you try.
- Rapport comes in two forms: Rapport by chance and rapport by design.
- **Rapport by chance**. For example, when you go to a country where people do not speak your language, you feel uncomfortable but you suddenly meet someone from your own country. You have a new best friend for your vacation at least.
- **Rapport is established when the interests or the behavior of two or more people are synchronized.**
- **Rapport by design**. When you have nothing in common with the person you are trying to connect with, rapport by design is established by deliberately altering your behavior, just for a short time, in order to become like the other person. A technique called "synchronizing" is to purposely reduce the distance and differences between another person and yourself by finding common ground.
